# 🛡️ Corporate Hedging & Arbitrage Opportunity Analysis 📈

### 🎯 Project Objective
This project investigates two distinct but related areas of corporate finance. First, it involves a practical audit of a real-world corporate risk management strategy by analyzing Nestle India's use of derivatives for hedging. Second, it develops a quantitative model to identify and validate a potential market-neutral arbitrage opportunity, benchmarking the returns against the risk-free rate.

**🛠️ Tools:** Microsoft Excel (for Financial Modeling & Data Visualization)

### ⚙️ Approach & Methodology

1.  **🔍 Hedging Strategy Audit:**
    *   Scrutinized the **'Notes to Financial Statements'** within Nestle India's official 2023-24 Annual Report.
    *   Identified and summarized the company's stated strategy for using **forward contracts** to mitigate financial risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
    *   The findings were compiled into a concise analytical report.

2.  **⚖️ Arbitrage Opportunity Modeling:**
    *   Developed a financial model in MS Excel to calculate the potential return from a spot-futures arbitrage strategy.
    *   The model computes an **annualized return of 7.8%** based on the observed price discrepancies.
    *   This return was benchmarked against the prevailing risk-free rate to validate the execution strategy and determine if the opportunity provides sufficient compensation for the minimal risk involved.

### ✨ Key Features & Analysis

#### 1. Real-World Derivative Strategy Audit
This project moves beyond academic theory by examining the actual risk disclosures of a major multinational corporation. It demonstrates the ability to read and interpret complex financial statements to understand a firm's real-world risk management posture.

#### 2. Quantitative Arbitrage Model
The core of the quantitative analysis is a model that not only identifies a potential arbitrage opportunity but also rigorously validates it. By benchmarking the 7.8% annualized return, the model provides a clear decision-making framework.
